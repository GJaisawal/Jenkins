1. Identify the Target Directory:
Determine the directory where you want Jenkins to create files and directories. For example, let's say it's /jenkinstest.

Create the Directory:
Ensure that the target directory exists. You can create it using the following command:

      bash

      sudo mkdir /jenkinstest

2. Grant Ownership to Jenkins User:
Change the ownership of the directory to the Jenkins user. Replace jenkins with the actual Jenkins user if it's different on your system.

       bash

       sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /jenkinstest

Grant Write Permissions:
Provide write permissions to the Jenkins user for the directory. This allows Jenkins to create files and subdirectories.

       bash

       sudo chmod -R 755 /jenkinstest

If you want Jenkins to have full control over the directory, you can use sudo chmod -R 777 /var/jenkins_workspace. 
However, be cautious with this approach, as it grants full access to everyone, and it might not be the most secure option.



















Sample Pipeline : 

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Create Directories') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Use your absolute path for directory A
                    sh 'mkdir -p /jenkinstest/jenkinstet/A'
                    // Use your absolute path for directory B
                    sh 'mkdir -p /jenkinstest/jenkinstet/B'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Create and Move File') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Create a file in directory A
                    sh 'echo "Hello, Jenkins!" > /jenkinstest/jenkinstet/A/sample.txt'
                    
                    // Move the file from directory A to directory B
                    sh 'mv /jenkinstest/jenkinstet/A/sample.txt /jenkinstest/jenkinstet/B/'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
