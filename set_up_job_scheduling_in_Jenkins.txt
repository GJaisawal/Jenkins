    Here are the steps to set up job scheduling in Jenkins:
	
	
    1. Open your Jenkins dashboard in a web browser.

    2. Navigate to the Job Configuration:
        > If you are creating a new job, click on "New Item" on the Jenkins dashboard.
        > If you are modifying an existing job, click on the job's name.

    3. Configure the Build Trigger:
        > Scroll down to the "Build Triggers" section.
        > Check the option that corresponds to the scheduling method you want. Common options include:
            > Build periodically: This option allows you to specify a cron-like schedule. For example, to run the job every day at 2 AM, you can use H 2 * * *.
            > Poll SCM: Jenkins will periodically check your version control system for changes, and if changes are detected, it will trigger a build.

    4. Save the Configuration:
        > Scroll to the bottom of the configuration page and click on the "Save" or "Apply" button to save your changes.
